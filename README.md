# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to explore and visualize the Iris dataset using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.  
This helps in understanding dataset structure, relationships between variables, and data distribution.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Iris Dataset  
- **Source:** Available via seaborn (`sns.load_dataset('iris')`)  
- **Features:**
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
  - Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

## ⚙️ Approach
1. **Data Loading**  
   - Loaded dataset using seaborn and pandas.
2. **Data Exploration**  
   - Checked dataset shape, column names, and first few rows.
3. **Visualizations**  
   - **Scatter Plot:** Sepal Length vs Sepal Width (colored by species).  
   - **Histogram:** Distribution of Petal Length.  
   - **Box Plot:** Spread of Sepal Length across species.

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Scatter plot shows clear separation between species based on sepal dimensions.  
- Histogram reveals distinct distribution patterns of petal length.  
- Box plot highlights differences in sepal length spread across species, with Setosa having the smallest range.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The Iris dataset demonstrates clear species‑level differences in flower dimensions.  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) confirms that simple visualizations can effectively distinguish between species.
